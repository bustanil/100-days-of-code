# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Initial domain model and JPA implementation.

**Thoughts:** Tried Lombok for the first time, it does help reduce boiler plate code especially when dealing with JPA entities. The drawback is that I have to use the annotations in fields, I don't fancy it because it "pollutes" the field definitions.
