# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Initial domain model and JPA implementation.

**Thoughts:** Tried Lombok for the first time, it does help reduce boiler plate code especially when dealing with JPA entities. The drawback is that I have to use the annotations in fields, I don't fancy it because it "pollutes" the field definitions.

### Day 1: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Initial implementation of the Sale user interface. Disabled Spring Boot DevTools. I don't really like that it hot reloads every time I compile the source code. It's already slow even though there are not many classes. The slow hot reload is because Hibernate takes time to boot up. It also break the UI state (need to find out why later).

**Thoughts:** So far everything is enjoyable, not gonna do too much UI styling. I believe I have to focus on the functionalities first. I'll beautify the UI later, when the functions are done.
